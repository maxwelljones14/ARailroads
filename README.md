## Astar-Implementations

In the Arailroads file, I have an implementation of A* that calculates the distance between two cities. 
The two cities can be changed into any cities from the arrNames file. Just change the list on line 41 of Arailroads


the A_star file is a Simple interactive A* idea. Just run the program, pick a grid size, follow the instructions for making walls, and run the program to
see the best path. distance is euclidean distance.
